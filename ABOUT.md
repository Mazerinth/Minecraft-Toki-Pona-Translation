# Why bring toki pona and Minecraft together?

Toki Pona is a relatively popular conlang ('constructed language') made by the linguist Sonja Lang. It is extremely minimalist, having a very simple grammar and a lexicon of only 123 words plus a handful of unofficial ones. This makes it very easy to learn but a puzzle to use since frozen compounds are highly discouraged.

Toki Pona is in a way the perfect sort of language for many games, and especially for Minecraft. Just as games tend to be simplified, easy-to-learn snapshots of the complicated mess that is real life, Toki Pona is a simplified, easy-to-learn version of the complicated mess that is natural language. In Minecraft you have to get creative with limited shapes and textures, to approximate all sorts of irl objects—e.g. a pressure plate and a painting for a laptop. The same thing goes for Toki Pona—there is no word for ’laptop’ but it can be approximated with ilo sona ‘knowledge tool’. Other parallels include:

 - Many alternatives in approximating an object: who can be the most ingenious?
 - Minimization of functionless words/items
 - Minimization of overly similar words/blocks
 - Minimization of overly detailed blocks/overly specific words
