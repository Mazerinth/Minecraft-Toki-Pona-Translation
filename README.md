# Minecraft-Toki-Pona-Translation

Minecraft has a number of translations into constructed languages: Lojban, Esperanto, Ido and Quenya, among others. One particular hero in the conlang community that hasn’t got so much attention is Toki Pona, a minimalistic language originally created by Sonja Lang in 2001. Toki Pona has only 120 words (plus ~7 unofficial ones), a simplified grammar, and a set of hieroglyphics (optional) which are all extremely easy to learn. To get around the ambiguity caused by the small vocabulary you have to focus on simpler concepts, context, and efficient ways to describe things.

Toki Pona is in a way the perfect sort of language for many games, and especially for Minecraft. Just as games tend to be simplified, easy-to-learn snapshots of the complicated mess that is real life, Toki Pona is a simplified, easy-to-learn version of the complicated mess that is natural language. In Minecraft you have to get creative with limited shapes and textures, to approximate all sorts of irl objects—e.g. a pressure plate and a painting for a laptop. The same thing goes for Toki Pona—there is no word for ’laptop’ but it can be approximated with ilo sona ‘knowledge tool’. There are many other parallels, including but not limited to…

Lots of alternatives in building/describing an object - who can be the most ingenious?
Minimization of functionless words/items
Minimization of overly similar words/blocks
Minimization of overly detailed blocks/overly specific words
