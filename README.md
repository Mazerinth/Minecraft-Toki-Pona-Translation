## Welcome to this translation project!

Download the **.zip file** for your Minecraft version, unzip, place it in your resource pack folder and select it in-game. You then need to change your in-game language to toki pona (ma ali) - you might need to scroll down to the bottom of the language list since they aren't all in alphabetical order.
