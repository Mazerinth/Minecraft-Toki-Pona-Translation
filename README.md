## Welcome to this translation project!

Click on and download the **.zip file** for your Minecraft version. Then unzip, place it in your resource pack folder and select it in-game. You then need to change your in-game language to toki pona (ma ali) - you might need to scroll down to the bottom of the language list since they aren't all in alphabetical order.

Between released, you can of course take the WIP file for the next version and place it inside a previous pack! The tp_ma file is kept up to date here.
