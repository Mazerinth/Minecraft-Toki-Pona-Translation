## Welcome to this translation project!

Click on and download the **.zip file** for your Minecraft version. Then unzip, place it in your resource pack folder and select it in-game. You then need to change your in-game language to toki pona (ma ali) - you might need to scroll down to the bottom of the language list since they aren't all in alphabetical order.

Latest release: v2.6 for Minecraft 1.16.5, now renamed to leko toki. Comes with community input, numerous improvements and fixes, title screen art, more splashes and a sitelen pona version!

CREDITS
Made by jan Masewin, with title screen art by jan Ronu. The sitelen pona version uses the linja pona and linja sike fonts, made by David A. Roberts and jan Lipamanka.
