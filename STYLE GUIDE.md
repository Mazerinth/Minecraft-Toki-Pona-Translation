# Translation Style Guide - jan Pipi Laso

I've been using the 120 official words, plus:
- pre-pu monsuta, kipisi, leko, pake and powe
- post-pu soko and taki, possibly usawi

Some roots have taken on niche or slightly ante meanings:
- alasa *v* search
- ante *v* alter, make changes
- kule *prep* colour, making compounds like *kule ma* or *kule kasi* less clumsy
- len *v* conceal
- lon *v* load
- mani *n* metal or crystal
- mun *mod* silvery
- poki *v* save, store
- pu *n* book... makes things a lot simpler
- supa *mod* flat (and horizontal), e.g. *palisa supa* 'planks'
- tu *v* split, halve. Needed to differentiate swords *ilo kipisi* from axes *ilo tu*
- wan *v* join
- soko *v* explode, as mushrooms do with their spores
- taki *n* sticky substance. Needed to differentiate sugar *ko suwi* and honey *taki suwi*

I've tried to minimise loan words but have kept many for convenience, e.g.
- *monsuta Kipa,* since the creeper is so iconic
- *poki Potu* 'bottle,' helps differentiate containers especially considering 1.17 bundles
- *mani Kopa* 'copper' and *mani Amesi* 'amethyst' since they are clumsy to describe

Finally, overly technical language is left untranslated, including:
- command feedback
- structure blocks
- complex terms like Unicode, OpenGL or Mipmap
